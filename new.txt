Complete Operational Flow Guide
8 Phases | 24 Steps | Order → Intake → Assignment → Execution → Settlement
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 
Overview
This document provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of how a load flows through the AXIS platform—from the moment a customer calls with freight to the final driver payout. Understanding this complete lifecycle is essential for all team members.
The Dual-Entity Model: Mega Logistics (ML) operates as the brokerage/3PL, handling customer relationships and sales. Mega Trucking (MT) operates as the asset carrier with 400+ trucks. The "First Right of Refusal" model ensures MT assets get first opportunity on every load before external carriers are engaged.
Quick Reference: 8 Phases
Phase	Name	Summary
1	Order Capture	Customer contact → Order entry → Validation → Load ID
2	First Right of Refusal	Capacity analysis → Safety gate → MT decision (accept/release)
3	Brokerage Coverage	(If MT releases) Carrier search → Tender → Confirmation
4	Load Execution	Pickup → In-transit tracking → Delivery → POD capture
5	Billing Cascade	Customer invoice → Carrier/MT payable created
6	Driver Settlement	(MT loads only) Pay calculation → Statement → Payout
7	Cash Application	Customer payment → Match to invoice → AP release
8	Intercompany Reconciliation	ML ↔ MT settlement → Books reconciled
 
Phase 1: Order Capture
Owner: Inside Sales / Customer Service (Jesus Fernandez's Team)
Step 1: Customer Contact
Customer calls or emails with freight need. This contact hits the Inside Sales/Customer Service team. The customer may be an existing account with a rate card, or a new customer requiring spot pricing.
•	Inbound calls routed to Customer Service queue
•	Emails parsed and categorized by AI
•	Customer Portal orders auto-created as DRAFT
Step 2: Order Entry
Inside Sales enters the load details into AXIS. Required information includes:
•	Origin: Full address, contact name, phone, pickup appointment time
•	Destination: Full address, contact name, phone, delivery appointment time
•	Dates/Times: Pickup window, delivery deadline, any appointment requirements
•	Freight Details: Commodity, weight, dimensions, piece count
•	Equipment: Type required (flatbed, pneumatic, walking floor, etc.)
•	Special Requirements: Tarps, chains, permits, hazmat, team drivers
Step 3: Order Intake Agent Validates
The AI-powered Order Intake Agent automatically performs validations:
Validation	Action if Failed
Customer Active Status	Block order, alert sales manager
Credit Limit Check	Block if over limit, route to credit review
Rate Card Lookup	Auto-populate pricing; if no rate card, flag for spot quote
Equipment Availability	Check if equipment type exists in fleet
Required Fields Complete	Highlight missing fields, prevent submission
Step 4: Load Created
Upon successful validation:
1.	Load ID Generated: Format ML-YYYY-NNNNNN (e.g., ML-2025-001234)
2.	Status: DRAFT → CONFIRMED
3.	Customer Rate Locked: From rate card or spot quote
4.	Load Visible: Now appears in Operations queue
 
Phase 2: First Right of Refusal
Owner: MT Dispatch (Tommy Simpson's Team)
This is where the ML/MT magic happens. Every confirmed load goes through First Right of Refusal before any external carrier is engaged. This maximizes MT asset utilization and margin.
Step 5: Capacity Optimizer Analyzes
The AI-powered Capacity Optimizer Agent examines MT's entire fleet:
•	Driver Location: Where is each driver right now? Who's closest to pickup?
•	HOS Status: Does the driver have enough hours for this trip?
•	Equipment Match: Is the right trailer type available and in position?
•	Deadhead Calculation: How many empty miles to reach pickup?
•	Profitability Score: Is this load profitable for MT at the house rate?
•	Next Load Positioning: Does delivery location set driver up well?
Step 6: Safety Sentinel Gates
CRITICAL: Before ANY driver can be recommended, Safety Sentinel validates their compliance status:
HARD BLOCKS	Override?	If Invalid
CDL Valid & Not Expired	NO	Driver excluded
Medical Card Valid	NO	Driver excluded
HOS Available for Trip	NO	Driver excluded
No Drug Test Violations	NO	Driver excluded
Equipment Inspection Current	NO	Equipment excluded
Soft Blocks (Manager Override with Documentation):
•	Random Drug Test Current (24-hour grace period)
•	Annual MVR on File (7-day grace period)
Step 7: Load Offered to MT Dispatch
The load is now presented to MT Dispatch with ranked driver recommendations:
1.	Status Changes: CONFIRMED → MT-OFFERED
2.	Dispatch Board: Load appears with AI-ranked driver recommendations
3.	Timer Starts: 30 minutes for next-day loads, 15 minutes for same-day
Step 8: MT Decision Point
OPTION A — MT ACCEPTS:
•	Dispatcher selects driver from recommendations (or assigns manually)
•	Status: MT-OFFERED → MT-ACCEPTED → MT-DISPATCHED
•	Driver receives push notification on mobile app
•	House Rate Locked: This is what ML will pay MT for this load
•	→ Proceeds to Phase 4: Load Execution
OPTION B — MT RELEASES:
•	Dispatcher clicks "Release to Brokerage"
•	Reason Code Required: No capacity, equipment mismatch, timing conflict, etc.
•	Status: MT-OFFERED → MT-RELEASED → BROKERAGE-QUEUE
•	→ Proceeds to Phase 3: Brokerage Coverage
OPTION C — TIMEOUT:
•	Timer expires (30 min next-day / 15 min same-day)
•	System automatically releases to brokerage
•	Status: MT-OFFERED → MT-RELEASED (AUTO) → BROKERAGE-QUEUE
•	Alert sent to dispatch manager
 
Phase 3: Brokerage Coverage
Owner: Brokerage Team (Andrew Swicegood)
This phase only occurs if MT releases the load. The brokerage team now finds an external carrier to cover the freight.
Step 9: Carrier Matching
The brokerage team (or Carrier Matching Agent) searches for external coverage:
1.	Carrier Database Search: Find carriers with lane history, capacity, and good performance
2.	Compliance Verification: Insurance current? Authority active? Safety score acceptable?
3.	Rate Negotiation: Discuss rate with carrier (must maintain ML margin)
4.	Tender Load: Send load details to carrier
5.	Status: BROKERAGE-QUEUE → EXT-TENDERED
Step 10: Carrier Accepts
•	Carrier confirms availability and rate
•	Rate Confirmation sent and signed
•	Status: EXT-TENDERED → EXT-ACCEPTED
•	Carrier Rate Locked: This is what ML will pay the external carrier
•	→ Proceeds to Phase 4: Load Execution
If No Coverage Found:
•	Status: COVERAGE-FAILED
•	Escalate to management
•	Contact customer for options (reschedule, cancel)
 
Phase 4: Load Execution
Owner: Driver (MT) or External Carrier
Step 11: Pickup
1.	Driver Arrival: Geofence triggers automatic check-in notification
2.	Loading: Freight loaded onto trailer
3.	BOL Signed: Driver signs Bill of Lading
4.	Photo Capture: Driver photographs load, seals, any damage
5.	Departure Confirmed: Driver marks "Picked Up" in app
6.	Status: MT-DISPATCHED or EXT-ACCEPTED → IN-TRANSIT
Step 12: In-Transit Visibility
The Visibility Agent monitors progress throughout transit:
•	GPS Tracking: Updates every 5 minutes (MT drivers via ELD, carriers via integration or macro)
•	ETA Calculation: Dynamic updates based on real-time location and traffic
•	Geofence Alerts: Automatic notifications at key milestones
•	Check Calls: Automated or manual status updates logged
•	Customer Portal: Customer can track shipment in real-time
Step 13: Delivery
•	Arrival: Geofence triggers arrival notification
•	Unloading: Freight unloaded at consignee
•	Delivery Receipt: Consignee signs confirming receipt
Step 14: POD Capture
THIS IS THE CRITICAL TRIGGER POINT — POD capture initiates the entire billing cascade.
•	Driver photographs signed POD via mobile app
•	Photos uploaded to load record
•	AI verifies signature present
•	Status: IN-TRANSIT → DELIVERED
•	→ Immediately proceeds to Phase 5: Billing Cascade
 
Phase 5: Billing Cascade
Owner: Finance Team (Lisa Clark)
POD capture is the trigger. Within minutes, AXIS automatically generates the financial documents.
Step 15: Customer Invoice Generated
1.	Auto-Generation: Invoice created within minutes of POD capture
2.	Invoice Contents: Load details, customer rate, accessorials, reference numbers
3.	Attachments: POD, BOL, any other supporting documents
4.	Status: DELIVERED → INVOICED
5.	QuickBooks Sync: Invoice auto-syncs, AR posted
6.	Customer Delivery: Invoice emailed and available in Customer Portal
Step 16: Carrier/MT Payable Created
If MT Covered the Load:
•	ML creates payable to MT at the house rate
•	This is an intercompany transaction (ML owes MT)
•	Example: Customer rate $2,500, House rate $2,100 → ML margin $400 (16%)
If External Carrier Covered:
•	ML creates payable to external carrier at agreed rate
•	Payment terms per carrier agreement (typically NET 30)
•	Example: Customer rate $2,500, Carrier rate $2,000 → ML margin $500 (20%)
 
Phase 6: Driver Settlement
Owner: MT Operations / Finance
This phase only applies to loads covered by MT drivers. External carrier loads skip directly to Phase 7.
Step 17: Load Hits Settlement Queue
Once POD is captured, the load automatically enters the driver settlement calculation queue. Loads are batched by week (typically Monday-Sunday).
Step 18: Driver Pay Calculated
Based on the driver's compensation agreement:
Pay Type	Calculation	Example
Percentage	X% of line haul revenue	27% × $2,100 = $567
Per Mile	$X per loaded mile	$0.55 × 850 mi = $467.50
Flat Rate	Fixed amount per load	$500 per load
Additional Pay Items:
•	Accessorials: Detention, lumper, TONU, layover
•	Bonuses: Safety bonus, fuel bonus, referral bonus
•	Reimbursements: Tolls, scales, permits (with receipts)
Deductions:
•	Advances: Cash advances, fuel advances
•	Deductions: Insurance, escrow, lease payments, ELD fees
•	Chargebacks: Damage claims, compliance fines
Step 19: Settlement Statement Generated
1.	Settlement Period: Weekly (typically Friday for prior week's loads)
2.	Statement Contents: Every load with miles, rate, gross pay
3.	Deductions Itemized: Each deduction listed separately
4.	Net Pay Calculated: Gross - Deductions = Net
5.	Driver Access: Settlement visible in mobile app before payday
Step 20: Driver Paid
•	Settlement approved by operations manager
•	Payment processed (direct deposit or fuel card load)
•	Driver sees deposit hit their account
•	Settlement marked complete in AXIS
 
Phase 7: Cash Application
Owner: Finance Team (Lisa Clark)
Step 21: Customer Pays Invoice
1.	Customer sends payment (check, ACH, wire)
2.	Payment hits ML bank account
3.	Bank feed imports transaction to QuickBooks
Step 22: Cash Applied in AXIS
•	Finance team matches payment to open invoices
•	AI assists with ambiguous payments (multiple invoices, partial payments)
•	Status: INVOICED → SETTLED
•	AR closed out in QuickBooks
Step 23: Carrier/MT Paid
Once customer payment is received, AP is released for payment:
•	External Carriers: Paid per agreed terms (typically NET 30)
•	MT (Intercompany): Accumulated and settled weekly
 
Phase 8: Intercompany Reconciliation
Owner: Finance Team (Lisa Clark)
Step 24: ML ↔ MT Settlement
For all loads MT covered during the settlement period:
1.	Calculate Total: Sum of all house rates owed from ML to MT
2.	Single Payment: One intercompany transfer processed
3.	Both Books Updated: ML records payment out, MT records payment in
4.	Reconciled: QuickBooks entries posted on both entities
 
Money Flow Summary
Example: MT-Covered Load
Customer Pays	ML Receives	ML Pays MT	MT Pays Driver
$2,500	$2,500	$2,100	$567
Customer Rate	Full Amount	House Rate	27% of House
Margin Distribution:
ML Keeps: $400 (16% margin)	MT Keeps: $1,533 (covers truck costs + profit)
Example: Brokered Load
Customer Pays	ML Receives	ML Pays Carrier
$2,500	$2,500	$2,000
ML Keeps: $500 (20% margin)
